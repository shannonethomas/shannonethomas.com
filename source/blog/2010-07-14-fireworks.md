we celebrated american independence day in hamburg, watching, from our hotel balcony, fireworks from the united states consulate.

ten days later, we've celebrated bastille day in paris.

the fireworks were set to music and silhouetted la tour eiffel, when she wasn't sparkling along with the fireworks behind her.

we were even treated to an impromptu fire-dancing performance.

the show in paris is something to behold. france may have her shortcomings, but she certainly knows how to choreograph fireworks.
