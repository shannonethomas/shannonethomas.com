anthropologie introduces [bhldn](http://www.bhldn.com/) with a simple question, "what if anthropologie did weddings?"

it's another genius "duh" move by the chain. it's the trend to have a personal, hand-crafted wedding, and anthropologie somehow fits this market, despite their status as an international chain selling mass-produced clothing. too bad they're not collaborating with [etsy](http://www.etsy.com/category/weddings?ref=fp_ln_weddings).
