August and September have been a busy blur.

There was a good deal of bicycling, including this little trip to the Mercer Slough to pick blueberries.

And then this slightly longer, two day trip for Bike MS. In total, Hans and I rode 152 miles.

For those who were kind enough to donate to Bike MS, I drew and printed a series of "THANKS!" cards.

When I wasn't doing client work, I practiced bookbinding—making it up as I went.

While at home, a new painting began to take shape.

And of course, harvesting the last of the summer crops and making delicious things—soups and sweet potato chips!
