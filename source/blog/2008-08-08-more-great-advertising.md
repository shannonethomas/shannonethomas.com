from facebook, LG is using the iphone's name to promote their ripoff. i can't wait to see the lines of people waiting to get their iphone like phones while listening to the buzz from developers looking forward to making iphone like apps.

seriously, to all the wannabe iphones in the world - this strategy may seem like a good idea, but it's just not.
