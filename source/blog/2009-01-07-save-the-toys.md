the recently passed [august 2008] consumer product safety improvement act protects parents and children from unsafely manufactured toys [toys with lead paint and the like] through a system of mandatory third-party testing and permanent labeling of toys. despite that nearly all instances of unsafe toy manufacturing in 2007 were found in toys whose production was outsourced to china, the act indiscriminately calls for the testing of all toys, despite quantity or location of production.

the problem is obvious: small manufacturers and crafters hardly have the means to afford the $4000 per toy fee to have their creations tested and stamped with approval. unless the legislation is revised, it seems inevitable that small toy makers and crafters will have to find a new line of work, and parents and children will have no choice but to consume the unoriginal creations of the toy manufacturing giants.
