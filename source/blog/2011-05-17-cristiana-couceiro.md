My current design crush, [Cristiana Couceiro](http://www.cristianacouceiro.com/), is a master of illustrative layout. Using a combination of illustration, photography, typography, and broad swaths of colour and pattern, she creates graphically simple yet conceptually complex pieces.


Despite her consistent use of colour and style, the work never feels stale, and each piece feels more like an original piece of art than a product of a proven process.
