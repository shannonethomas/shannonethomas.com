before leaving saint louis, it seemed necessary to run around with a camera, capturing all of the [underappreciated] [gems of saint louis](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alwaysayingoodbye/sets/72157605522455816/). so that's what we spent the first of june doing. we didn't manage to photograph everything on our list, but we did get some interesting photos of [spring ave](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alwaysayingoodbye/2565043281/in/set-72157605522455816/), [saint francis de sales](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alwaysayingoodbye/2565921224/in/set-72157605522455816/) and [city hospital](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alwaysayingoodbye/2565043301/in/set-72157605522455816/).
