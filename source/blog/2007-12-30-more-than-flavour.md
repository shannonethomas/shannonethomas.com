some people like their wine dry. some people like their wine oaky. some people like their wine earthy with moderate tannins.  
  


i like my wine to be well-labelled. and if the producing winery has a nice website, bonus points.  
  


so here are ten favourites.  
  


![mad housewife wine](/blog/old-uploads/2008/03/madhousewife.jpg)  

ten: mad housewife  

flavours: merlot, chardonnay, white zinfandel and cabernet sauvignon  

easy to come by and inexpensive, mad housewife comes in a variety of flavours, each with its own clever notquiteright housewife photo. their [website](http://www.rainierwine.com/) isn't great, but they get bonus points for their serial labelling.  
  
  



![the maitre d](/blog/old-uploads/2008/03/maitred.jpg)  

nine: the maitre d  

flavour: cabernet sauvignon  

one of many great wines from [mollydooker wines](http://www.mollydookerwines.com/), the maitre d's label is all around good design. good use of pattern, typography and imagery, with a touch of humour to boot. it gets bonus points, of course, for the website.  
  
  



![the innocent bystander](/blog/old-uploads/2008/03/innocentbystander.jpg)
eight: the innocent bystander
flavour: sangiovese merlot, shiraz viognier, pinot gris and pinot rosé  

simple and elegant, the innocent bystander's design is a combination of careful stencilling and serendipitous ink splatter. the [site](http://innocentbystander.com.au/), unfortunately, doesn't follow the same minimalist approach.  
  
  



![bitch grenache](/blog/old-uploads/2008/03/bitch.jpg)  

seven: bitch  

flavour: grenache  

perhaps i only like this wine because of its provocative title, all in pink. and the seventyseven repetitions of the word "bitch" on the back. more likely, it's the bottle's alternating dagger heart dagger heart border. you can find this barossa grenache at [the grateful palate](http://www.gratefulpalate.com/), but the sweet little red doesn't have a site of her own.  
  
  



![root 1](/blog/old-uploads/2008/03/root1.jpg)  

six: root:1   

flavours: cabernet sauvignon and sauvignon blanc  

root:1 is a lovely example of straight on the bottle printing. these bottles possess a classy combination of serif typeface with simple imagery, a design that translates well to their [website](http://www.root1wine.com/).   
  
  



![lo tengo](/blog/old-uploads/2008/03/lotengo.jpg)  

five: lo tengo  

flavours: torrontés and malbec  

these aren't labels you can appreciate until you have the bottles in front of you. they're holographic, and, depending on whether you're sipping a white or a red, show either a couple's feet dancing or a classic dip kiss. they're a product of [bodega norton](http://www.norton.com.ar/), but you'll have a hard time finding anything to do with lo tengo on the site.  
  
  



![7 deadly zins and 7 heavenly chards](/blog/old-uploads/2008/03/7zins7chards.jpg)  

four: 7 deadly zins and 7 heavenly chards  

flavours: zinfandel and chardonnay  

two bottles from [lodi vineyards](http://www.lodivineyards.com) take fourth in the battle for good labelling. each has a clever name, made even more clever by its counterpart. better yet, both have even managed to inspire artist [michael godard](http://www.artistmichaelgodard.com/art/wine).  
  
  



![mia’s playground](/blog/old-uploads/2008/03/miasplayground.jpg)  

three: mia's playground  

flavour: cabernet sauvignon, merlot and zinfandel  

this wine is all about threes, so i couldn't help but to make it third on the list. the label contains the perfect combination of quirky text and imagery, topped off with a barrel of [three] monkeys. all made possible by [three loose screws](http://www.donsebastianiandsons.com/threeloosescrews/).  
  
  



![oops](/blog/old-uploads/2008/03/oops.jpg)  

two: (oops)  

flavour: carmenere merlot, cabernet franc, carmenere rose, carmenere, sauvignon blanc and cabernet sauvignon  

oops wines come in a variety of distinctly coloured flavours, such as "spicy splendor" and "gentle giant". the labels are heavy with newspaperlike text, but hardly difficult to look at, especially with the prominent (oops) logo providing an anchor. the [website](http://www.oopswines.com/) is consistent with the label design, and the brand even manages their own [blog](http://www.oopswinesblog.com/). 
  
  
  


![bonny doon](/blog/old-uploads/2008/03/bonnydoon.jpg)  

one: bonny doon framboise  

flavour: framboise [dessert]  

[bonny doon vineyards](https://www.bonnydoonvineyard.com/) have a history of incredible wine label design, which is largely why their framboise tops my chart. the bottle's slender shape is perfectly accented with the encircling lace. it's the perfect combination of thoroughly elegant yet slightly suggestive - everything a wine should be.
