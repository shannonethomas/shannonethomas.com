i've upped my level of consumption–more art, more design, more experiences–and my work is reflecting this new fullness. recent inspiration comes a number of sources, from the frequently consulted [magritte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/René_Magritte) to the freshly discovered [tom bagshaw](http://www.mostlywanted.com/). his brushwork both embraces the nature of painting and conceals it behind a porcelain veneer. his figures are real and unreal, porcelain figurines in muted landscapes with the occasional monster stopping by. while his technique alone is worth marveling at, the flawlessness with which he combines pop culture references within renaissance composition is a conceptual delight. there's something [travis louie](http://travislouie.com/) about [reliquary](http://www.mostlywanted.com/portfolio-1/reliquary/), while [umii bozu](http://www.mostlywanted.com/portfolio-1/umi-bozu/) feels like a riff on suzanna and the elders.
