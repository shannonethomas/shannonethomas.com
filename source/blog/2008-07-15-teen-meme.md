[everyone else](http://davario.livejournal.com/30861.html) is doing it, so i went ahead drew myself as a teen and myself now.

some things have changed. i went from one pair of dirty pumas to over fifty pairs of heels, flats, tennies, etc. i wear skirts and actually bother to brush my hair in the morning. i colour coordinate. i dress like a girl.

but i still do the whole paint stain thing.
