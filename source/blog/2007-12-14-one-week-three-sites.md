they're everywhere!  
  
[](http://www.infuz.com)[infuz](http://www.infuz.com) launched their new site on monday, after a tedious three months of development. yes, there are still glitches, but overall it's still nice bit to look at. my major contribution to the site was the fog and condensation, inspired by the glass in hans's shower. reproducing the effect was nowhere near simple, nor is the final execution up to my perfectionist standards, but it's definitely a starting point.  
  
i also redesigned my [grapholio](http://grapholio.shannonethomas.com/) tuesday afternoon, the code part of which was surprisingly fun. i have a great deal of work i have yet to document and represent, so i expect updates will be occurring fairly soon. and with the nature of this business, frequently thereafter.  
  
and now i have made my first entry into this blog where i try desperately to keep up with design trends and to keep comments about clients to myself.  
  
so three sites in one week, and i'm spent.
