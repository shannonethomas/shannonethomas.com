hans and i spent last night printing winter solstice cards, which got me contemplating my fine art training in relationship to my career in the advertising industry. it's an advantage, contrary to what some might think. it's not as though i'm stuck in the past, it's not as though it's kept me from understanding how the industry changes or from keeping up with technology. rather, it gives me a mental library of concepts and images to choose from that extends beyond the trendy world of interactive design. creation is, after all, mostly reinvention. so why limit sources of inspiration to web and interactive?
