after one of many pleasant bus rides home, [hans](http://hans.gerwitz.com/2009/02/23/bus-driver-appreciation-day.html) and i were admiring the skill and usual friendliness of seattle's bus drivers, and we wondered if, perhaps, there was a day devoted to these often underappreciated transportation heroes. we found  no such day, and realised we had no choice but to create one. [bus driver appreciation day](http://seattletransitblog.com/2009/03/11/next-wednesday-is-bus-driver-appreciation-day/) is officially happening this upcoming wednesday, the 18th of march. so pick up some flowers and a nice card or two, and appreciate your bus driver.
