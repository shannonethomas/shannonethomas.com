"as an artist, your organize your life so you get a chance to paint, a window of time, but that's not guarantee you'll create anything worth all your effort. you're always haunted by the idea you're wasting your life."

_diary_ was a quick grab off of the bookshelf for reading through the flights to and from los angeles. my last palahniuk was _invisible monsters_, and he seemed as fitting an author as any to bring with me to the land of sunshine and superficial.

i enjoyed diary a good deal more than _invisible monsters_, perhaps not surprisingly with the main character a painter. palahniuk recites details of art history that i missed in my own education, the catastrophes and misfortunes of a long lists of artists, and i feel it necessary to revisit the facts. surely some artists were able to paint without such burdensome tragedy?

"what you don't understand you can make mean anything."

i think about my own tragedies, mostly brought about by my own inflated expectations, my own imagination outperforming the world in which i live. of course, most psycho-whatevers will tell you that the key to happiness is to lower expectations, to avoid disappointment. but low expectations don't beget masterpieces.

"all the effort in the world won't matter if you're not inspired." 

then againâ€¦

"did perpetual happiness in the garden of eden maybe get so boring that eating the apple was justified?"
