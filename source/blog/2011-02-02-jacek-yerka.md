i'm lost in the imaginings of [jacek yerka](http://www.yerkaland.com/). jacek's paintings play with references to art history. from monet's [haystacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haystacks_(Monet)) to bruegel's [tower of babel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tower_of_Babel_(Bruegel)), the paintings combine traditional technique with the whimsy of [studio ghibli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli), twisting the obvious into the fantastic, and giving life to impossible creatures and landscapes.
