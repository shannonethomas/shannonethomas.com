last weekend, hans and i traveled east for washington d.c.'s [cherry blossom festival](http://www.nationalcherryblossomfestival.org/cms/index.php?id=390). unfortunately, due to [american airlines'](http://www.aa.com/index_us.jhtml) mass cancellations, we missed most of the daylight of what was supposed to be our first day in d.c. and, with the help of a storm that night, the cherry blossoms were more in the lake than on the trees surrounding it.

otherwise, [the trip](http://flickr.com/photos/alwaysayingoodbye/sets/72157604595466670/) was a success.
