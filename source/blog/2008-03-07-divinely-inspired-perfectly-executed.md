work has been the usual insanity - a fierce yet typical blend of both client and coworker drama. besides leaving me feeling exhausted and without control, i also find myself in an inspirationless rut. so where do i escape to revitalise? to the studio, where i am responsible for everything from inspiration to execution.

my most recent executions have been smaller than usual, the smallest being the [princess tinies](http://flickr.com/photos/alwaysayingoodbye/2297701552/in/set-72157600597618088/), and the larger being a less thematic than usual [series](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alwaysayingoodbye/2294797833/in/set-72157600597618088/) of female figures. but as much as i enjoy a finished piece, the goal is not in the product. it's in the learning, and sometimes there's no better way to rediscover inspiration than ditching all thoughts of the office for an evening.
