we should not seek inspiration to create. we should create, and in this process of creation, find inspiration.

we visit museums and galleries, concerts and symphonies, films and plays, to reinvigorate ourselves. we read the words of great authors, we study the thoughts of great philosophers, we listen to our idols, hoping their ideas will make us feel something that we cannot help but make tangible. but the subsequent flame of creativity has a short wick, and soon dies. this is not the flame of true inspiration, but rather, the desire to imitate our heroes, the desire to produce **something **great.

inspiration cannot be fulfilled by the creation of anything tangible, no more than inspiration is something that can be wrought from the tangible. the creative masterpiece is merely a byproduct of the creative process, a process that focuses on the creation of inspiration and the inspiration to create. lather. rinse. repeat.
