Perusing an old stack of _Art in America_ magazines, I came across an artist responsible for much of my undergrad inspiration: Vincent Desiderio. His technique is traditional, and his works are figurative and narrative, even when the people are absent. Perhaps most influential was his use of non-literal pattern—repetition in collections of objects and human bodies—rather than simple prints on fabric.
