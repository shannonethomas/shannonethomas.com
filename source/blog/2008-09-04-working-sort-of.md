i've reentered the working world, and it's about time too. after all, summer couldn't last. the days are shortening and the rain is less than a month away. and i would be focusing on my work, if only microsoft could get windows installed on the machine they've supplied me. it really is deliciously ironic.

honestly though, there's more silver lining than cloud. every day that the "cannot proceed" error plagues the windows installation means an afternoon off for me. and with weather like this, it really could not get any better.
