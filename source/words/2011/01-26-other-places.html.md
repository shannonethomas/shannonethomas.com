while vacationing los angeles for my birthday, we visited [GR2](http://www.giantrobot.com/) to see the work of ulises alfonso farinas. it was a lovely collection of comic inspired ink drawings, full of whimsy and hidden details. the pieces explode with patterns and textures, all perfectly executed in what could easily be an off-the-supermarket-shelf black ballpoint pen. i cannot wait to see what ulises does next, for new adventures into his imaginarium full of bizarre creatures, landscapes, and everything in between.
