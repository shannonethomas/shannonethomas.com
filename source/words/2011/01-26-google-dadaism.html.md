it began with an hour of free time one friday afternoon. i wanted to play a design game, try something new. not some generic tutorial or design exercise, but my own conceptual [and slightly dadaist] photoshop project. so i began with a book, and, eyes closed, i pointed to a word. darkness.

i began there, google image searching. the rules we this: select an image from the first page of google image results. choose a noun from the image. image search again. repeat times nine.

the noun list was this: darkness, moon, diagram, biology, da vinci, flight, whale, water, plastic, junk.

![ten degrees of google](01/20110126-originals.png)

the results, respectively, were: a watery night landscape, a moon phases diagram, a diagram of the heart, a da vinci fetus sketch, a da vinci flying machine sketch, the comic book _flight_, an aquarium, a floating plastic bottle, a circle of plastic trash, and a collection of urban type spelling "junk science."

i composited these images in a variety of ways to create a surprisingly conceptual piece, at least considering its dada origins
