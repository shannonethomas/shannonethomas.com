![A is for Ashley, allergic to makeup.](08/20110811-AisforAshley.png)

I've said for years that I would revisit _The Tragedies and Mishaps of Beautiful Women_. I've even attempted to revisit the Gashlycrumb-inspired series since that first rushed print-job my senior year of college, but I gave up on both mezzotint and graphite versions without ever making much progress.

Now I've taken up the series again, this time with pen and ink. I've also added a new element—hand lettering—my new favourite obsession. Ashley is finished; Betsy is next.
