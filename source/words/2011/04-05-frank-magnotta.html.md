i'm in love with the works of [frank magnotta](http://www.fmagnotta.com/index.html). these complex pieces manage to not only lead the eye, but also the mind around, searching for the purpose of the [rube goldberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg)-like compositions. i can only imagine how impressive the life-size drawings would be in person.
