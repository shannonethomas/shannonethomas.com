Recently, I've been consuming more pretty than usualâ€”300+ images a day, in fact. It's easy for these images to go in one eye and out the other, and I've been playing with a number of image bookmarking techniques to keep that which is worth remembering around for later reference.

As of now, I'm using a combination of [ffffound](http://ffffound.com/home/shannonethomas/found/), [tumblr](http://shannonethomas.tumblr.com/), and [pinterest](http://pinterest.com/shannonethomas/). The order listed is the order in which I began using the imagemarking tools.

For a time, I also used stars in Google Reader to mark favourites; however, having only the ability to mark content coming through RSS was wildly insufficient.

After much playing around with the various tools in my ever-evolving workflow, I've come to use ffffound for painting, drawing, and other fine art inspiration; I use tumblr for design inspiration; and I use Pinterest for images I suspect will be useful in building moodboards.

Ultimately, I'd like to see all of these collections come together into one place, where all images could be perused and small collections consumed. This tool would have curation modes for both personal and public viewing, would work across devices, and would have social smarts with a touch of serendipity. And then, of course, I'd like similar collection tools for self-observation [nike+, fitbit, garmin, daytum, gowalla] and portfolio [gawker, society6, behance, deviantart, linkedin] sites.
