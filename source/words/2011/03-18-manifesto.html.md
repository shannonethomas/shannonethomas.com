![manifesto](03/20110404-manifesto.png)
i do not write [this manifesto](03/manifesto.pdf) in an effort to define creation or my beliefs on it. i write, instead, to capture the thoughts of this moment, as i am sure i will do again.

_at this particular moment, i'm enjoying the bi-polar weather of a seattle weekend in february. this time of year holds such promise. the blueberries and cherry already bud, and crocuses are reaching towards the sun. soon, i will be planting summer feasts._

_something surreal is happening in the studio. a series, less serial than others, less conversational between the canvases. paintings that talk to themselves, inform themselves, and break their own realities. the audience has been pushed off the ledge. the artist no longer holds sente. the paintings exist for themselves alone._

_design remains utilitarian, though beauty emerges more and more from the unexpected. especially the distractions. the more i am distracted, the more i want to be distracted. time, money, and all things practical prefer i maintain focus._

**time is the agent of reflection.**

this manifesto is one of many created with only the purpose of being argued, rejected, and reinvented in mind.

_to live by a manifesto is artistic suicide. once a movement becomes an -ism there is no freshness, only prescription. in science, we create theories to rigorously test what we know is true. to prove truth right, and more often, to prove truth wrong. art is no different._

_ i certainly hope that what i know now to be true is far from what i know next decade to be true. and the decade beyond that. what a boring journey it would be to always be right!_

control. what a beast. i want it and i want to lose it. and i want control over when i do one or the other.

_i let my emotions have me. and the stream of beautiful consciousness fills me with ideas. but i cannot create in this state. my hands need logical direction. the mapmaker must regain control of the pandemonium. then, i create._

**i need no problem and my process no definition.**
 
i create for the act of creating. i create for the end creation. i make rules, question them, disregard them, and move on. this is both art and an art.

**processes are unique to the artist and her work.**

perhaps the most important rule we can hold process to is that of evolution. document only to destroy. write to replace. give up when the process is irrelevant. or when it's completely relevant.

_in art, my process is to paint. i might do a loose sketch first, or perhaps collect a few images that inspire me. i might write a couple of sentences about what i think the painting will be about. inevitably, after eighty hours of paint cover the canvas, all of this will be lies._

_as i paint, new elements enter my sphere of inspiration, and the story becomes something new, something more true than whatever notions i began with._

_in design, this is less true. there is rarely time enough to let design tell its own story. there is rarely silence enough to hear design's words over the rumpus of wants. design dies on the timeline to the client is always right._

process creates. process communicates. process stales when meaning wears off.

**art creates culture and expands language.**

_art without culture has no basis and no repercussions. without language, we lose meaning. art is how we speak of the art, design is a message, communicated. without cultural familiarity, an artist has no hope of sharing her intent with the audience, and without common language, design has no hope of delivering its message. we can, of course, reduce language to a set of icons, but those, too, are based on shared understanding._

what would art be without culture? without language? misunderstood.

**tradition informs.**

_tradition is ours to manipulate and disregard. while it is present in every idea we have and mark we make, while we may not ever be able to escape the legends before us, only we can make the work new. only we can make tradition fresh, for those that will follow us._

_there is no outsider. we all belong to something, and acknowledging the history of that something is essential to the telling of our story._

**tradition changes.**

_i create in a tradition. i take it, appropriate it. make it mine. make it my autobiography. my creations are born from the chaos of my consumption. of art and essays on art. of literature and essays on literature. of life and essays on life. i am the great regurgitator of all that i see. and think. and feel. my autobiography is making sense of my personal chaos._

_of course, regurgitating chaos is nothing special. we watch the resulting messes repeat themselvesâ€“on reality tv! it is the refined intention and graceful execution that makes art._

**the most valuable design is not of any object, but of the self.**

_designing the self begins with a refining of one's environment. we take what we like, keep it, and add more. we take what we don't like, remove it, and avoid it. we surround ourselves with people who inspire us, who make our work better, and who make us better. we surround ourselves with things that inspire us, motivate us to create, and make our creations stronger._

we create boundaries through failure. we crash against them, often forgetting they exist. then we change course. heading a different direction, but still towards failure. we fail again. and again. and again. until we don't.

**it is imperative to growth that we define, understand, and embrace our own failures.**

_who defines failure? the critic, who lives in a one-sided conversation that takes but never gives. it's easy to be the critic. to say this is wrong. or that could be better. the critic will never be great. we allow the critic this power, the ability to tell us when we've failed. only with our belief can it be true._
