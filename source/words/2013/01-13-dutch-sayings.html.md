I've recently discovered the rabbit hole of dutch expressions. It's a magical, nonsensical world in here. I'm logging a few of my favourites, hoping that someday they might make more sense.

Nou breekt mijn klomp!
That breaks my wooden shoe!

Het sop is de kool niet waard.
The water isn't worth the cabbage.

Lekker is slechts een vinger lang.
Tasty is just one finger long.

Gebraden duiven vliegen niet.
Roasted doves don't fly.

Helaas, pindakaas.
Oh well, peanutbutter.
