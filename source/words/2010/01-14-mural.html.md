over the holiday break, i completed a mural in our second floor bathroom. it's an intimate space, and the mural ended up wrapping around three of the room's four walls.

mural painting is, of course, very different from the paintings on canvas i typically do, and i often found myself sore in the mornings from the previous day's contortions. aside from the difference in scale and mobility, i worked in acrylic housepaint, a much faster drying medium than the oil paints i'm used to.

as far as being finished, i doubt the mural is. i envision myself revising and adding creatures over time, aiming for that ever-elusive perfection.

lastly, i was kind enough to document my work throughout the process, so enjoy the timelapse video:
