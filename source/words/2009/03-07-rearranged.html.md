with the fresh light of spring and a feeling of near finish on the current series, i have not only been spending more time in the studio, but also finding myself frustrated with how uncomfortable the studio makes me feel. so, in hopes of keeping my spirits high, i've rearranged - the furniture, the paintings, everything. and the result is quite fantastic. there are few things i enjoy more than discovering the unintentional interactions of gaze and expression as of my characters meet on one wall.
