a couple of thoughts from my workday, in haiku form:

**micromanagement**
just change that one thing.
and that thing. and that thing too.
now it looks so great.

**bad ideas**
do you make them good
or prove how awful they are?
that is the question.

and then another thought, after getting a new high score of 108k in bejeweled blitz:

**accomplishment**
i make things pretty
but break for games. new high score!
thatâ€™s when i take pride.
