after seeing and lusting after [varmints](http://www.amazon.com/Varmints-Helen-Ward/dp/0763637963/ref=pd_bbs_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1213976372&sr=8-2) at [powell's](http://www.powells.com/), i finally gave in and bought the book. the story's message is told mostly through the illustrations by [marc craste](http://www.ventilate.ca/issue07/marc_craste.html), which are beautiful integrations of text and image. a wonderful book for any artist, though intentioned for an older crowd than the average children's book.
