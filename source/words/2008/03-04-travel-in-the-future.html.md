saint louis had a lovely weekend. temperatures in the seventies and cool breezes that were a bit strong for cycling but perfect for walking. but now it's back to the misery of winter, below freezing temperatures and wintery drizzle, and i cannot wait to escape.

there are two bits of travel in my immediate future, the nearest, a trip to washington d.c. for the [cherry blossom festival](http://www.nationalcherryblossomfestival.org/cms/index.php?id=390). i have never been to d.c. and am very much anticipating the [national gallery of art](http://www.nga.gov/) and the [national portrait gallery](http://www.npg.si.edu/). any other suggestions?

in early may, i'll be heading west to las vegas to see [the blue man group](http://blueman.com/) [hans's birthday gift]. besides taking in all of the inauthenticity that vegas has to offer, we also have plans to see some friends and a [cirque du soleil](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/CirqueDuSoleil/en/default.htm) show while we're in town.
