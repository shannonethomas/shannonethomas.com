i've recently stumbled upon [penguin's](http://us.penguingroup.com/) illustrated classics at our  [local bookstore](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bailey-coy-books-seattle). my first penguin classic is [jane eyre](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142005142/), illustrated by the amazing [dame darcy](http://www.damedarcy.com/).

others include [the three musketeers](http://www.amazon.com/Three-Musketeers-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe/dp/0143105000/) illustrated by [tom gauld](http://www.cabanonpress.com/), [fairy tales](http://www.amazon.com/Fairy-Tales-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe/dp/0143039520/) illustrated by [anders nilsen](http://www.margomitchell.com/thc/an.htm), and [little women](http://www.amazon.com/Little-Women-Penguin-Classics-Deluxe/dp/0143105019/) illustrated by [julie doucet](http://www.juliedoucet.net/).

it is somewhat disappointing that, as thoughtful and well-executed as the illustrated classic project is, it's had so little publicity. penguin doesn't even take the time on their site to distinguish the illustrated classics from their deluxe editions. it's a shame that such good work should go unnoticed for a simple lack of marketing.
