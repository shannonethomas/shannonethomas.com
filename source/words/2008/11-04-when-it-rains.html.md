the summer months have drawn to an end and seattle has turned cold and rainy, which i of course used as an excuse to go shoe shopping - specifically for rain boots.

the world of rain boots is far more vast than i ever would have imagined, and, as i scoured [nordstorm's](http://nordstrom.com/) flagship store, i couldn't help but take note of my favourites.

seen above are some of the higher end galoshes from fashion elite's [burberry](http://www.burberryusaonline.com/), [coach](http://www.coach.com/) and [juicy couture](http://www.juicycouture.com/).

these are the more affordable, yet equally as cute options from [sporto](http://www.piperlime.com/browse/categorySearch.do?cid=19944) and [roxie](http://www.roxy.com/).

and then, of course there's [chooka](http://www.chookaboot.com/), makers of an incredible selection and my own [fat bird](http://www.chookaboot.com/products/rainboots/fatbirddots.html) galoshes [far left].
