four days, three nights, and nine long airport hours spent in las vegas makes for a very anticipatory landing in saint louis.

we wasted our first hours in vegas wandering the strip, waiting for the mgm to allow us to check in. as we expected, there was little for two non-gambling vegetarians under forty to enjoy. and the men at the casino entrances prying into our marital status and the details of our stay were little help.

fortunately, we had a fairly busy schedule with tickets to the blue man show, cirque du soleil's zumanity and an evening catching up with some friends.

the vegas version of the blue man show was very much like the versions in other cities, though the setup was much more elaborate, including, at one point, the appearance of an enormous prop plane onstage. 

cirque du soleil's zumanity was a bit of a disappointment, with the costumes being far less inspiring than i had hoped, and the acts being more comedic than physically impressive.

our final night in vegas was spent at red rock casino with longtime friends anna and jim. we finally made it around to seeing 21, which was of course enhanced by our presence in vegas.

hoping to catch an earlier flight home, hans and i headed to the airport immediately upon checkout. unfortunately, there were no earlier flights available and our flight was delayed, so we spent nine hours in the airport. but at least, in the city where everything costs and no one accepts credit, the airport had free wifi.
