movie trailer â‰  utility trailer. ad placement fail.

google carries the phenomenon one step further. a search for "trailer" brings up organic results consisting of movie trailers - juno, the dark knight, indiana jones, etc., while all sponsored links are utility trailers. furthermore, related searches include car trailer, motorcycle trailer, enclosed trailer and equipment trailer, completely ignoring the ever-so-organically popular movie trailer. talk about different audiences... you have to wonder what sort of clickthrough those ads are getting.
