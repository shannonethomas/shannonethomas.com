last saturday was a day for protesting,  as [cities across the country](http://www.flickr.com/groups/946033@N23) joined together to rally against california's passing of [proposition eight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_8_(2008)). here in [seattle](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alwaysayingoodbye/sets/72157609413273464/), we were part of the estimated six thousand who marched from volunteer park to westlake center with very few [naysayers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/alwaysayingoodbye/3043087768/in/set-72157609413273464/) along the way.

to quote king county executive [ron sims](http://ronsims.wordpress.com/), "if you are going to talk about immorality: talk about hunger. that is immoral. talk about war. that is immoral. but do not tell me that when two people love each other that is immoral."
