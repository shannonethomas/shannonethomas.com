in an effort to expand my culinary horizons, i've begun a tradition of trying a new recipe every sunday evening. this sunday's explorations included a delightful [apple onion cheese tart](http://www.designspongeonline.com/2008/10/in-the-kitchen-with-susan-schawke-of-artstream-studios.html), a pear and chevre salad [of my own divine inspiration] and [brownies](http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/One-Bowl-Brownies/Detail.aspx) with pumpkin icecream.
