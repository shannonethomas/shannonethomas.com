i've been working vigorously on the new series, hoping to get as far as i can before my days become consumed with paycheck-earning work. today i began four new pieces, lightly sketching and then doing quick, one-hour-or-less turp washes [burnt umber + turpentine + paper towel + as little brush as possible]. 

working smaller allowed me to get caught up in the details of painting, but my new, larger canvases are forcing me back into the habit of being a big picture painter. sure, the eyes still get more attention in the early stages than my art school teachers would approve of, but i'm following my training with a combination of [sketchbook planning](http://sketches.shannonethomas.com/) and loose underpaintings. thus, no part of the painting is left unplanned, though all is loose enough to allow for the natural evolution of artmaking.

so enjoy a first look at the paintings of the "midnight in the garden" series.
