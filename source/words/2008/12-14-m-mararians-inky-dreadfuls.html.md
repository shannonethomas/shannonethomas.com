i am drawn to [michael mararian's work](http://www.inkydreadfuls.citymax.com/), naturally, as it resembles both technically and conceptually some of my earlier work as an art student. self-described as "an artist whose career has been built on the disillusionment of perfect american values and time honored tradition of the joy of childhood and the assumptions of the happiness it brings to all," [m. mararian's thoughts](http://themongrel.com/2008/12/09/inky-dreadfuls-a-conversation-about-values/) on his art and his reasons for creating resonate with me no less than the work itself.

"some subscribe to the notion that artists create work to help delve into themselves - to 'fight their demons' so to speak.

i would agree with that statement but i think ultimately it would be a detriment to the artist if he or she actually achieved those goals. what if an artist fought their demon and won? what would their art look like after that? i would argue that itâ€™s probably best to not progress as an artist in fear that all resolutions will hinder the creative struggle which ultimately delivers the viable and meaningful fruits of labor."
