after twenty four and a half years in saint louis, the time has finally come to move west. and north. and very, very far away.

plans are fairly certain at this point. boxes are packed, the farewell party is scheduled, even the cat has a reservation to fly to our new home. 

**moving**
hans and i depart for our cross-country road trip 3 june, stopping in denver, salt lake city, boise and portland before anchoring in our seattle apartment atop capitol hill. all of our stuff should dock shortly after we do.

**working**
hans starts his new job at [frog design](http://frogdesign.com) the monday after we arrive in seattle, flying to new york his first week for his first department meeting. in the meantime, i'll continue working with [infuz](http://infuz.com) on a freelance basis until i find a new agency home.

**entertainment**
with countless coffee shops, independent theatres and [urban outfitters](http://urbanoutfitters.com) all within walking distance, i doubt i'll struggle to find something to do. i also have a list of galleries i'll be visiting to acquaint myself with the seattle art scene.

**family**
my cat lands in seattle less than two weeks after we do. my parents will be accompanying her and staying through the weekend. my aunt, uncle and cousin are coming out several weeks after that. 2100 miles away, and i'll still be incredibly busy with family.

let the countdown begin: twelve days remain of this midwestern girl's landlocked life.
