Most notably in June, we had wood floors put in the studio. It's a great improvement over the paint-stained carpeting it replaced.

While displaced from the studio, I did a good amount of sketching.

As usual, there was plenty of travel.

The month ended perfectly, winning this lovely T-Rex at the [OpenBeam](http://blog.openbeamusa.com/) party at [metrix](http://metrixcreatespace.com/).
