every three to six months i get the unignorable itch to redo one of my websites, which usually leads to the unignorable itch to redo all of my websites [in case you've lost count, that's five sites - two blogs, two portfolios and a splash page]. since it's inception in june 2006 [just after my college graduation], the artfolio portion of my website has had no fewer than five designs. my grapholio has had at least three variations, and the sketch and word blogs have had at least two since their creation just under a year ago.

so i have the itch. and you've been warned of the greatness to come.
