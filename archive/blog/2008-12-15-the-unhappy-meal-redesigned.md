in perfect juxtaposition to the artwork of [my previous post](http://words.shannonethomas.com/2008/12/14/m-mararians-inky-dreadfuls.html), i bring you the [ new packaging](http://www.thedieline.com/blog/2008/12/mcdonalds-new-p.html) of [mcdonald's](http://www.mcdonalds.com/).

with the redesign, [boxer creative](http://www.boxercreative.co.uk/) was hoping to "change the way the world feels about eating mcdonald's food". sorry guys, until there's soy protein on the menu, there's no changing the way this vegetarian sees the chain.
