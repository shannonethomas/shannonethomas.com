sketchbooks capture raw moments of uncertain thought, moments where decisions are still being made and final product is yet a distant notion. we toss them aside, holding their imperfections against them. no client, no collector, no publisher wants the unfinished scribble.

and yet, we find leonardo da vinci's monumental sketches in florence's [uffizi gallery](http://www.uffizi.com/). while the masses may clamor to see the mona lisa in the [louvre](http://www.louvre.fr/louvrea.htm), many of us artists would much rather get lost in the line quality and uneven detail of his unfinished pieces.

this long-winded prelude introduces my latest source of inspiration: [_sketchbooks: the hidden art of designers, illustrators & creatives_](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6341998-sketchbooks). after flipping through only once, i've already established this as one of my go-to books when i have creative block or simply when i wish to be inspired.
