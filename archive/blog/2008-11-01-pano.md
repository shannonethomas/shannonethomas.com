[pano for iphone](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=293709029) makes wonderful panoramas. just point, shoot, point, shoot, point, shoot, wait, and voila - a [panorama](http://www.flickr.com/groups/iphonepanoramas/) is born!

this demonstration shows how well pano handles light changes, as it shifts from low light to sunlight and then back again. also, this photo gives a sneak peek into my studio.
