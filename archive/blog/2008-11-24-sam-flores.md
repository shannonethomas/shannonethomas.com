in a recent interview with [juxtapoz](http://www.juxtapoz.com/), artist [sam flores](http://www.samflores.com/) does a beautiful and unpretentious job of talking about his art, his inspiration and his process.

"seeing wasted talent makes me sad; people having so much talent and opportunity and just letting it go, spending half their life doing nothing and talking about what they're going to do but never actually doing it."

"i see people going through life every day with their heads down and blinders on, and they're just unaware of anything in life. i think that's one thing i portray in my work, how people can go through a world so beautiful and not see any of it or be so shut off from it."
