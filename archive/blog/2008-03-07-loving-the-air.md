i've spent two weeks with my [macbook air](http://www.apple.com/macbookair/), arachne the younger. her older sister, the twelve inch powerbook, has been passed along to somebody who can live with the power pc, and i have been left with only one regret: i have yet to find a fashionable bag to protect my new, slimmer laptop.

after perusing sites such as [timbuk2](http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/home), [vy & elle](http://www.vyandelle.com/) and [freitag](http://www.freitag.ch/shop/FREITAG/page/frontpage/detail.jsf), i think i have settled on one of tom bihn's [new bags](http://www.tombihn.com/page/001/PROD/200/TB0223). i've never owned a laptop specific bag, and thus worry that the new bag will scream professional in a way that my old, doodled upon, pinned up, army surplus bag could never have managed.

seriously though, i've never had any issues with customisation, and i certainly don't plan to start any time in the foreseeable future.
