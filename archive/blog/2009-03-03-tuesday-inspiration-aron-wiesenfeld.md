ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present the amazing work of [aron wiesenfeld](http://www.aronwiesenfeld.com/).

besides the familiar subject matter, i also find myself intrigued by his use of light, particularly in the charcoal pieces. it's a beautiful style mix reminiscent of illustrator [chris van allsburg](http://www.chrisvanallsburg.com/flash.html) and painter [john currin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Currin).
